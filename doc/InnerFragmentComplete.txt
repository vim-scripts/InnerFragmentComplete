DESCRIPTION				   *InnerFragmentComplete-description*

The built-in insert mode completion |i_CTRL-N| searches for entire keywords.
Often, variable names share many identical fragments, but if you want to
complete from fragments inside of variables (e.g. "KeyValue" from
"SpecialKeyValue"), it won't work, because the usual completions only offer
whole keyword matches.

SEE ALSO								     *

- The anchoring to individual fragment characters is re-used from
  CamelCaseComplete (vimscript #3915), but applied here only to fragments
  inside CamelCaseWords or underscore_words, not whole words.
- BidiComplete (vimscript #4658) can complete inner (or leftmost) fragments
  when there's already a completion base after the cursor.
- Check out the |CompleteHelper.vim| plugin page (vimscript #3914) for a full
  list of insert mode completions powered by it.

==============================================================================
USAGE						 *InnerFragmentComplete-usage*

In insert mode, invoke the inner fragment completion via CTRL-X i
You can then search forward and backward via CTRL-N / CTRL-P, as usual.
								  *i_CTRL-X_i*
CTRL-X i		Find matches for inner fragments. It first searches
			inside CamelCaseWords and underscore_words, either for
			matches of the keyword characters before the cursor at
			the inner fragment start, or for fragments whose
			individual words begin with the typed letters in front
			of the cursor. (The latter requires the optional
			|CamelCaseComplete.vim| plugin, and then works like
			with the strict |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-C| completion.)
			The completion base starts with the first uppercase
			character before the cursor (so "myCust" would find
			fragments starting with "Cust", e.g. in
			"SpecialCustomer"), or the keywords (excluding the
			underscore character, to be able to trigger completion
			inside an underscore_word) before the cursor. If the
			first keyword character is lowercase, the inner
			CamelCase matches will be converted to start
			lowercase, too.
			If there is a fragment before the completion base
			(e.g. "My" in "MyCust", or "end_" in "end_foo") the
			completion not only offers matching inner fragments,
			but also the complete word match, in order to complete
			prefixed new words with existing full words.
			For CamelCaseWord fragments, matches at the start of a
			CamelCaseWord are also valid, as long as it's not the
			entire CamelCaseWord that is matched (e.g. "CC"
			matches "CamelCase" in "CamelCaseWord").

			If that doesn't find any matches, a fallback search
			will pick up base matches anywhere inside a word (e.g.
			"comp" will match "compress" inside "decompress").

EXAMPLE					       *InnerFragmentComplete-example*

The text contains "CamelCaseWords". To write "PascalCaseWords", start either
with "PascalCaseW" (unique text match), "PascalC" (several text matches), or
"PascalCW" (unique fragment match).

The text contains "ConfigurationItem". To write "SystemConfigurationItem",
start with "SystemCo" (full text match) or "SystemCI" (full fragment match).

INSTALLATION				  *InnerFragmentComplete-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim InnerFragmentComplete*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES				  *InnerFragmentComplete-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.
- Requires the |CompleteHelper.vim| (vimscript #3914) plugin, version 1.32 or
  higher.
- |CamelCaseComplete.vim| (vimscript #3915) plugin, version 1.01 or higher
  (optional).

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION				 *InnerFragmentComplete-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:

	 *b:InnerFragmentComplete_complete* *g:InnerFragmentComplete_complete*
Analoguous to the 'complete' option, you can specify which buffers will be
scanned for completion candidates. Currently, '.' (current buffer), 'w'
(buffers from other windows), and 'b' (other listed buffers) are supported. >
    let g:InnerFragmentComplete_complete = '.,w,b'
The global setting can be overridden for a particular buffer
(b:InnerFragmentComplete_complete).
						 *InnerFragmentComplete-remap*
If you want to use a different mapping, map your keys to the
<Plug>(InnerFragmentComplete) mapping target _before_ sourcing the script
(e.g. in your |vimrc|): >
    imap <C-x>i  <Plug>(InnerFragmentComplete)

HISTORY					       *InnerFragmentComplete-history*

1.10	04-Apr-2014
- ENH: When the completion base is prefixed by a fragment (e.g. "my" in
  "myFoo"), also offer full keyword / CamelCaseWord matches, not just inner
  fragments, as the default completion / CamelCaseComplete would not use that
  base, yet it is helpful when completing "myFooBar" from "FooBar".
- ENH: Also match from the start of a CamelCaseWord without a base prefix. But
  then, there must be additional (unmatched) fragments after the match to
  avoid overlap with the CamelCaseComplete completion.

1.00	19-Dec-2013
