DESCRIPTION
The built-in insert mode completion i_CTRL-N searches for entire keywords.
Often, variable names share many identical fragments, but if you want to
complete from fragments inside of variables (e.g. "KeyValue" from
"SpecialKeyValue"), it won't work, because the usual completions only offer
whole keyword matches.

SEE ALSO
- The anchoring to individual fragment characters is re-used from
  CamelCaseComplete (vimscript #3915), but applied here only to fragments
  inside CamelCaseWords or underscore_words, not whole words.
- BidiComplete (vimscript #4658) can complete inner (or leftmost) fragments
  when there's already a completion base after the cursor.
- Check out the CompleteHelper.vim plugin page (vimscript #3914) for a full
  list of insert mode completions powered by it.

USAGE
In insert mode, invoke the inner fragment completion via CTRL-X i
You can then search forward and backward via CTRL-N / CTRL-P, as usual.

CTRL-X i                Find matches for inner fragments. It first searches
                        inside CamelCaseWords and underscore_words, either for
                        matches of the keyword characters before the cursor at
                        the inner fragment start, or for fragments whose
                        individual words begin with the typed letters in front
                        of the cursor. (The latter requires the optional
                        CamelCaseComplete.vim plugin, and then works like
                        with the strict i_CTRL-X_CTRL-C completion.)
                        The completion base starts with the first uppercase
                        character before the cursor (so "myCust" would find
                        fragments starting with "Cust", e.g. in
                        "SpecialCustomer"), or the keywords (excluding the
                        underscore character, to be able to trigger completion
                        inside an underscore_word) before the cursor. If the
                        first keyword character is lowercase, the inner
                        CamelCase matches will be converted to start
                        lowercase, too.
                        If there is a fragment before the completion base
                        (e.g. "My" in "MyCust", or "end_" in "end_foo") the
                        completion not only offers matching inner fragments,
                        but also the complete word match, in order to complete
                        prefixed new words with existing full words.
                        For CamelCaseWord fragments, matches at the start of a
                        CamelCaseWord are also valid, as long as it's not the
                        entire CamelCaseWord that is matched (e.g. "CC"
                        matches "CamelCase" in "CamelCaseWord").

                        If that doesn't find any matches, a fallback search
                        will pick up base matches anywhere inside a word (e.g.
                        "comp" will match "compress" inside "decompress").

EXAMPLE
The text contains "CamelCaseWords". To write "PascalCaseWords", start either
with "PascalCaseW" (unique text match), "PascalC" (several text matches), or
"PascalCW" (unique fragment match).

The text contains "ConfigurationItem". To write "SystemConfigurationItem",
start with "SystemCo" (full text match) or "SystemCI" (full fragment match).
